Helloooo! ~`` I just now unprivated my account so now people can follow me if they really wanna..💕💕

#1 TheoBaldTheBird Fan!! ; Why is this bird so good at PvP - In unstable he could probably easily defeat Wemmbu in my personal opinion-

Anyways-!! About me; I'm not exactly a social person because I think people will think I'm weird - So I'd rather you interact first!! On ponytown you can C+H freely! I like Minecraft and MCC if you couldn't tell by the rest of my profile! I really like specificaly Minecraft PvP and Smp content like Lifesteal, Infuse, Bliss, Unstable, and Etc cause I'm not naming all of that bro💔 (Anyways in these parts; MAGNET DUO IS YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY)



Pst: 'It's all yours.'
